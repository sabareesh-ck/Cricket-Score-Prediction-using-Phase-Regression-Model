# Cricket Score Prediction using Phase Regression Model

## Project Overview

This repository contains code for predicting cricket scores using a Phase Regression Model. While the repository lacks a detailed initial description, the core component is implemented in the `main_code.ipynb` notebook, which provides the foundation for score prediction. This README aims to guide you through understanding, setting up, and potentially contributing to this project.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Score Prediction:** Utilizes a Phase Regression Model to forecast cricket scores.
*   **Jupyter Notebook Implementation:** Provides a clear and interactive environment for experimentation and modification.
*   **Potential for Improvement:** The foundation is laid for further development, feature additions, and model refinement.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

*   **Python 3.6 or higher:**  The primary programming language used.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For running and interacting with the `main_code.ipynb` file.
*   **Required Python Libraries:**
    *   pandas
    *   numpy
    *   scikit-learn
    *   matplotlib (or similar visualization library)
    *   [Any other libraries explicitly used within `main_code.ipynb`]

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
# Add other dependencies as needed based on main_code.ipynb
```

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sabareesh-ck/Cricket-Score-Prediction-using-Phase-Regression-Model.git
    cd Cricket-Score-Prediction-using-Phase-Regression-Model
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependencies (see Prerequisites & Dependencies section).**

3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook main_code.ipynb
    ```

4.  **Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the prediction model.**

## Usage Examples

The `main_code.ipynb` notebook contains the core implementation of the Phase Regression Model.  Inspect the notebook for specific code examples and instructions.  The notebook should contain:

*   **Data loading and preprocessing:**  How the cricket data is loaded and prepared for the model.
*   **Model training:**  The specific code used to train the Phase Regression Model.
*   **Prediction:**  Examples of how to use the trained model to predict cricket scores.
*   **Evaluation:** Metrics to assess model performance (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).

## Configuration Options

Currently, there are no explicitly defined configuration options outside the `main_code.ipynb` notebook. However, potential configuration points within the notebook may include:

*   **Data source:**  The location of the cricket data used for training.
*   **Model parameters:**  Adjustable parameters within the Phase Regression Model.
*   **Evaluation metrics:**  Choices for different metrics to assess model performance.
*   **Data preprocessing parameters:** Configurations for feature scaling and transformation.
